# turnout.network Ubiquitous Language

This is a reference glossary for terms and structures in turnout.network, designed for both technical agents and human-facing applications.

## Moment

A specific call to action in space and time—like a protest, meeting, shift, or event. The person who creates it is considered its organizer. They define the opportunities for it. People who commit to those opportunites start a turnout.  This is the smallest unit of collective coordination on the network.

## Opportunity

A defined role or way to contribute to a moment. Set by organizers when creating a moment. Examples include: "Show Up," "Safety Coordinator," "Street Medic," "Legal Observer." Opportunities can have limits or be open-ended. They represent the different forms of will and ways that a moment requires.

## Turnout

A turnout begins when a participant commits to an opportunity. It records what actually happens—whether someone confirmed, canceled, showed up, marked themselves late, or was checked in. Each turnout is a micro-log of interaction with a moment. Turnouts may be public or private, and can inform social transparency, accountability, and future coordination.

## Participant

Anyone who commits to a moment by selecting an opportunity. Participants can be anonymous or named. Participation does not require an account or profile. Anyone can participate in one or many moments, and each participation generates a turnout.

## Organizer

Anyone who creates and maintains a moment. Organizers define opportunities, send invites, manage check-ins, and can view participant turnout histories (depending on visibility settings). Organizers may work alone or as part of a distributed team.

## Testimonial

A short, visible statement one user can leave about another, based on shared work in a moment. Testimonials reflect trust and experience—not status or endorsement. They appear on public profiles when enabled and help support trust-building across the network.

## Profile

An optional, participant-controlled record of public turnouts and testimonials. A profile is not a self-authored identity—it emerges from action and recognition. Profiles help organizers discover reliable collaborators and give participants a way to reflect their own history of showing up.
