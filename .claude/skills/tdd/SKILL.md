# TDD Writer

Write technical design docs to guide an implementer. Use this skill when you have a clear feature definition and need to design the system to implement it.

## When to Use This Skill

- After PRD approval, before engineering starts
- PMs working closely with engineering
- Technical product managers
- Teams shipping backend features or APIs

## The Problem

PRDs describe **what** to build. Engineers need specs that describe **how** to build it. Without a TDD, engineering makes assumptions that may not align with product intent.

## What You'll Need

**Critical inputs (ask if not provided):**

- Feature name and PRD link/summary
- High-level requirements (what should the system do?)
- User actions that trigger the system

**Nice-to-have inputs:**

- Existing architecture context
- Performance requirements
- Integration constraints

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context

First, read the user's context files. most importantly:

- `context/INSPIRATION.md`
- `context/VISION.md`
- `context/ROADMAP.md`
- `context/ARCHITECTURE.md`

Next, see if a TDD already exists for this feature. If so, read it and use it as a starting point. If not, look for any related TDDs that might provide relevant context. TDD's can be found in and should live in `context/tdd`.

Also read any prd's that the user has called out. For example, if they say "this is for prd0001", read that prd. Those files can be found in `context/prd`. If the user has not called out a prd, look for one that matches the feature name or description.

**Tell the user what you found.** For example:

> "I found 'Resource Planning v2' in your product.md roadmap. Your Jordan persona (PM) needs to see team workload at a glance. I'll design the API and data model around Jordan's workflow."

### Step 2: Gather Feature Details

If the user hasn't provided a PRD, ask:

> "I need to understand the feature before writing the spec:
>
> 1. What feature is this spec for? (I found [X] in product.md — is that it?)
> 2. What user actions should trigger this functionality?
> 3. Are there any existing systems this needs to integrate with?
>
> Or share the PRD if you have one."

### Step 2.5: Clarify Requirements

Think critically about the PRD. Along with the rest of the context you have, such as ARCHITECTURE and ROADMAP, does the PRD give you enough information to write a spec? If not, ask the user for more details. For example:

> "The PRD says 'users can create resource allocations' — but what does that look like? What fields do they need to provide? What validations should we have? Do we need to track who created it and when? The more details you can give me, the better the spec will be."

**Do NOT generate a spec with placeholder architecture. Get the requirements first.**

### Step 3: Define Scope and Components

Identify all system components involved:

- Frontend changes
- Backend services
- Database changes
- Third-party integrations
- Background jobs/workers

### Step 4: Design Data Model

Create database schema with:

- Table definitions
- Field types and constraints
- Indexes for performance
- Relationships (foreign keys)
- Migration strategy

### Step 5: Specify API Endpoints

For each endpoint, define:

- HTTP method and path
- Request parameters and body
- Response shape with status codes
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting considerations

### Step 6: Document Authorization

Create permission matrix — connect to personas:

- Who can access what (reference personas.md roles)
- Role-based access control
- Resource-level permissions
- Edge cases (owner vs admin, etc.)

### Step 7: Handle Edge Cases and Errors

Document:

- Error states and messages
- Validation rules
- Concurrency considerations
- Rollback scenarios

### Step 8: Performance and Migration

Address:

- Expected load and scale
- Caching strategy
- Database migration plan
- Feature flag strategy
- Rollback plan

## Data Model

### New Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE resource_allocations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NOT NULL,
    hours_per_day DECIMAL(4,2) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),

    CONSTRAINT valid_date_range CHECK (end_date >= start_date),
    CONSTRAINT valid_hours CHECK (hours_per_day > 0 AND hours_per_day <= 24)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_allocations_project ON resource_allocations(project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_allocations_user ON resource_allocations(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_allocations_dates ON resource_allocations(start_date, end_date);
````

### Schema Changes to Existing Tables

| Table   | Change   | Reason |
| ------- | -------- | ------ |
| [table] | [change] | [why]  |

### Migration Plan

1. Create new tables (non-breaking)
2. Backfill data from [source]
3. Add new columns to existing tables
4. Deploy new code
5. Clean up old columns (future PR)

## API Design

### Endpoints

#### Create Allocation

```
POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/allocations

Request:
{
    "user_id": "uuid",
    "start_date": "2026-04-01",
    "end_date": "2026-04-30",
    "hours_per_day": 6.0
}

Response (201 Created):
{
    "id": "uuid",
    "project_id": "uuid",
    "user_id": "uuid",
    "start_date": "2026-04-01",
    "end_date": "2026-04-30",
    "hours_per_day": 6.0,
    "created_at": "2026-03-15T10:30:00Z"
}

Errors:
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid dates or hours
- 404 Not Found: Project or user not found
- 409 Conflict: Overlapping allocation exists
```

## Authorization

### Permission Matrix

_Based on personas.md roles:_

| Action            | Admin (Alex) | Manager (Jordan) | Member (Sam) | Client |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| View allocations  | Yes          | Own projects     | Own          | No     |
| Create allocation | Yes          | Own projects     | No           | No     |
| Update allocation | Yes          | Own projects     | No           | No     |
| Delete allocation | Yes          | Own projects     | No           | No     |

### Edge Cases

- **Project archived:** No new allocations, existing remain read-only
- **User deactivated:** Allocations preserved for historical data

## Error Handling

| Error               | HTTP Status | Message                             | Recovery       |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Invalid date range  | 400         | "End date must be after start date" | Fix input      |
| User not found      | 404         | "User does not exist"               | Verify user ID |
| Allocation conflict | 409         | "Overlapping allocation exists"     | Modify dates   |

---

## Performance Considerations

**Expected Load:**

- [x] API calls per minute at peak
- [Y] records in database at 12 months

**Caching Strategy:**

- Cache allocation lookups by project (5 min TTL)
- Invalidate on create/update/delete

---

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Internal Beta

- Feature flag: `resource_planning_v2`
- Enable for internal team only

### Phase 2: Limited Rollout

- Enable for 10% of customers

### Phase 3: General Availability

- Enable for all customers

### Rollback Plan

**Trigger:** Error rate > 1% or P50 latency > 500ms
**Process:** Disable feature flag

## Framework Reference

**Engineering Spec Best Practices:**
- Architecture before implementation
- API contracts before code
- Migration plan before deployment
- Rollback plan before launch

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use your context files** — I'll connect the spec to personas and roadmap
2. **Have the PRD ready** — Specs follow requirements, not the other way around
3. **Include engineers early** — They should review the spec before it's "final"
4. **Think about edge cases** — What happens when things go wrong?
