# The Turnout.Network Vision

**A living network of showing up:  where community, commitment, and cooperation come together in action.**

_Note: this document is aspirational, describing the future vision of the network._

## Overview

It's hard for us to move together. Not because we don’t care, but because we live in a world built to grab our attention, not channel our energy. We get overwhelmed by feeds, distracted by group chats, or lost in apps that reward scrolling more than showing up.

Even when we _want_ to say yes, the follow-through slips away. The link gets lost. The details are vague. The calendar fills up. It’s nobody’s fault—but it still means we don’t move.

turnout.network is a growing pattern of trust and momentum. It helps us help each other show up. Someone makes a moment. Someone shares it. Someone says yes. A few of us remember, a few more tag along, and suddenly, we’re there—together, in space and time.

The turnout.network: people keeping their word, together, one small promise at a time.

It’s for anyone who wants to be part of something real.

If you’ve never shown up before, it’s a simple way to start.

If you’ve been organizing for years, it clears the way for others to join you.

If you’re somewhere in between—trying to help, trying to do more—it’s built for that, too.

## The Turnout Cycle

### Creating a moment

When something needs doing, someone makes a moment. A time, a place, a reason. Something people can say yes to.

On turnout.network, that means creating a simple call to action with a date, a time, a place, and a short description. The moment becomes a link: easy to share, easy to pass along, easy to commit to. No login required. No flyers or campaigns. Just a clear ask, ready to be answered.

### Showing up for it

Then people start to say yes. They commit. It just takes a tap, a name, a promise made visible. That moment becomes real because someone decided to be part of it. A reminder lands. The time comes. And they show up—not alone, but with others who said yes too.

When someone RSVPs, turnout.network sends them smart reminders—timed to help, not spam. Add it to your calendar, get directions, change your mind if needed. At the moment itself, check-in makes the commitment visible—not to perform, but to be counted. This is the core of the network: people showing up, counted, together.

### Moments to Momentum

Every time we show up, we get stronger—individually, and together. We learn who’s steady. We start to recognize each other. Trust builds through action. Moments connect. Patterns form. And what began as one invitation becomes the start of something we can build on.

turnout.network knows who’s shown up, and it uses that history to help new moments grow. Looking for another moment to show up for? The network surfaces it. Creating one yourself? It brings the steady hands that you didn't know were nearby.

## The Shape of the Network

turnout.network isn’t just a tool—it’s an ecosystem. What it does _and_ what it refuses to do are equally important. These are some of the principles and capabilities that shape how the network works in the real world.

### From First Moments to Global Movements

turnout.network is simple enough for one person to create their first moment—but it’s built to grow with you. As your momentum builds, the network supports more moments, more participants, and more people stepping in to help.

You can run three moments a week or thirty. You can bring in co-organizers and distribute the load. The network doesn’t require roles and permissions up front, but it supports them when they emerge—because organizing isn’t a fixed structure, it’s a pattern of shared responsibility.

Whether you're organizing a neighborhood cleanup, a mutual aid network, or a national campaign, turnout.network scales by staying focused on what matters: helping people say yes, helping them follow through, and helping organizers know who’s ready for more.

### The Open Door Principle

turnout.network prioritizes participation over protection. It’s built to be easy to enter, easy to commit, and easy to pass along—because that’s what showing up requires.

We’re not trying to replace encrypted channels like Signal or build hardened infrastructure for secure organizing. Those tools already exist and do their jobs well. This network is for the moments before and after those channels—when it’s time to say yes, share the link, and show up.

That means we don’t promise secrecy or strong identity guarantees. It’s open by design—and fragile by necessity. If what you’re doing depends on secrecy, use Signal. If what you’re doing depends on turnout, we’re here.

### Connects with What You Already Use

You don’t need a whole new set of tools. turnout.network moments work with what people are already using to coordinate: group chats, email threads, calendar invites, SMS lists, even flyers with QR codes.

Whether you organize in a Signal thread, a Discord server, or a church bulletin, turnout.network plugs into the way your community already talks to itself. The goal isn’t to create a new platform—it’s to make action show up _in the channels where you already have trust_.

We’re not asking people to switch tools. We’re giving them a way to move in sync, wherever they already are.

### Shared Work, Shared Words

Your profile on turnout.network isn’t something you write—it’s something that’s built through action and trust.

Every moment you show up for becomes part of your public or private history. Others see what you’ve done, if you choose to share it. And when you’ve done something real with someone—when you’ve organized together, worked a shift, or showed up side-by-side—you can leave a short, visible testimony. A record of shared effort.

This kind of transparency makes it easier to move together. It helps people step into new moments with more confidence, and helps organizers invite others into deeper roles—based on shared history, not guesswork.

### As Free as Possible

turnout.network isn’t freemium. We don’t lock useful features behind payment walls or hide basic functionality until you upgrade.

Instead, anything that’s cheap to run is free to use. The only things we charge for are the parts that cost real money to operate—like mass messaging, high-volume coordination tools, or deeply custom infrastructure. When that happens, it’s usage-based, not tiered.

The goal is to keep the network accessible at every level of participation. Whether you’re showing up for your first moment or coordinating a national campaign, you’ll never hit a paywall just for doing the work.
