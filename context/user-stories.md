## Individual Stories

### Alice

Alice has never done any sort of activism before in her life. A friend texts Alice, "want to come to this anti-ice protest?" and sends Alice a link. Alice follows that to the event page on the turnout.network.

That event page shows her the where and when of the event (10 AM, Main Street), the what of the workspace and organizers for that workspace, and the what of the event. There's a big RSVP now! button.

She clicks on the button and theres a dialog. It asks for her phone number so we can text her a confirmation code. It asks for her name -- but the field is prefilled with a randomly generated name (eg BlueWombat) and lets her reroll the name or enter her own name. She enters "Alice Wombat" because she actually likes wombats and her name is alice after all. Then she clicks OK.

After she clicks OK, she gets taken to a "check your messages" screen that tells her to check her damn messages and follow the link there.

At the same time, she gets a single SMS message: click here to confirm! She clicks, and it takes her to turnout.network where she is prompted to add turnout.network to her home screen and allow notifications. She does so.

Then, she gets an app notification "You're signed up for this anti-ice protest! Add it to your calendar?" and she gets a single click that will add it to her google calendar or whatever the apple walled garden equivalent is. The calendar event will include the address of the protest.

Later that week...

Early Friday night she gets an app notification: "Dont forget the anti-ice protest tomorrow at 10am at blah blah blah! Still going?" letting her click confirm or cancel

She goes to bed. The next day...

9 AM: she gets her first reminder from the app: "The Melt ICE Protest is happening in an hour!" with the options "Ill be there" and "Sorry I cant make it" and "Give me Directions". She asks for directions and it pulls up google maps on her phone.

She gets over there but she's running late. At 10AM she gets one more notification, but the options are "Im on the way" "Sorry I cant make it" and "Give me directions". She taps "Im on the way"

She gets there and because the PWA is still running on her phone, it gives her a "Welcome!" notification and only gives her an option to check in.

She waves around a sign and walks around with a bunch of people who also are protesting. She goes home and she goes to bed.

The next day...

At some reasonable hour (say 10AM), she gets another notification "You Did Your Part at the Melt ICE protest! What did you think?" and when she clicks on it, she gets to leave a little mini-feedback text about the event. After she does that, she is taken to her first-time profile setup screen, which lets her put in her profile, find other events in the area, and set her profile as public so that other organizers in her area can reach out to her

### Bob

Bob lives in a small town in rural Oregon. Population 8,000. There's no local activist scene, no existing infrastructure. And he's never done anything remotely activist or remotely organizing before.

But the town council just approved a new gravel mine on the edge of town that's going to destroy the local creek, and Bob is pissed. And he's got a group chat with five friends who are also mad about this mine. They've been complaining in the chat for two weeks.

Finally Bob says "fuck it, we should do something." One of his friends says "yeah but like what?" After a couple beers on Thursday night, Bob googles on his android "how to organize a protest". He finds some articles. He finds some tooling websites that want him to pay $50/month. He finds the turnout.network, which says "free forever" and "start in 2 minutes." He clicks "Start Organizing."

The platform starts with the helpful hint of "dont think too hard about this, you can change it later" and then asks him a few things:

- "What are you organizing for", he answers "Stop the gravel mine from destroying willow creek"
- "What are you calling your group?", and the helpful ai suggestion is "Save Willow Creek", he accepts that
- "Who are you"? Same username setup as alice has (OrangeArmadillo is suggested, he just uses his real name)

After all that he gets a screen about "Whats Your First Event?" It has one big CTA card at the top: "Most people start with a planning meeting" and then a bunch of smaller cards below it for other types of events. There's a bunch of those, and he doesn't know what they are, but his eye sticks on "most people start with a planning meeting". So he taps on that.

The next screen he sees has a few more fields, some prefilled:

- "Event Name", is prefilled with "First Planning Meeting", he leaves it
- "Where", lets him pick a local coffee shop that he and his friends go to
- "When", lets him use a calendar/timepicker to pick next Friday night at 6pm

With that massive effort out of the way, he gets one last screen: invite!

Because he's still on his phone, it shows him a prewritten invite text message with an RSVP link, and lets him use WebShare to share it out to his phone contacts, and on facebook. Because yes, Bob is still using facebook.

Bob goes to sleep happy that he has managed to at provide some minimal activation energy to his friends to get started fighting this damned gravel mine nonsense.

### Cathy

Cathy has participated in community organization in a mid-level role. She hasn't ever started anything, but she has helped others who have started things. Her friend started a community art nonprofit, and Cathy helped promote it to drive participation and attendance. Her partner was on the local community council, and Cathy helped set up both regular meetings and special neighborhood events.

She gets an idea to organize...
