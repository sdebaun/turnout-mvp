# turnout.network Ubiquitous Language

This is a reference glossary for terms and structures in turnout.network, designed for both technical agents and human-facing applications.

## Group

A named organizing entity containing multiple turnouts and managed by one or more organizers. Represents an ongoing organizing effort—whether a goal-oriented campaign, mutual aid network, community project, or any collective action. Examples include "Save Willow Creek" (fighting a gravel mine), "Local Love Project" (food distribution), or "North Avenue Tool Library" (resource sharing). Groups enable collaboration by allowing multiple organizers to share the work of creating and managing turnouts, and maintain a consistent thread and reputation across those turnouts over time.

## Turnout

An organizing effort within a consistent area of operations—like a protest, food distribution program, or community meeting. Has a primary location and time for display and discovery. Contains one or more opportunities that define specific ways to participate. The person who creates it is considered its organizer. Examples include "Climate March" (area: downtown, primary location: City Park, primary time: Saturday 2pm), "Food Distribution - Fairgrounds" (area: fairgrounds complex, primary location: Building A, primary time: Saturday 10am), or "Planning Meeting" (area: coffee shop, primary location: Joe's Coffee, primary time: Thursday 7pm). The term emphasizes active mobilization—you don't just attend a turnout, you turn out and make it happen.

## Location

The answer to "where do I need to be?" for participants. Can be physical (with coordinates and address for navigation) or virtual (with meeting link to join). Physical locations enable "Get Directions" to buildings, parks, or street corners. Virtual locations enable "Join Meeting" for video calls. Locations are reusable across turnouts and opportunities, ensuring consistency when the same place is used repeatedly. Examples: "Fairgrounds Building A" (physical), "Planning Call Zoom Room" (virtual), "Main St & 5th Ave intersection" (physical meeting point).

## Opportunity

A specific way to participate in a turnout. Defines where to meet (meeting location), when to meet (meeting time), and optionally what role to fill (specialty). Participants RSVP to a specific opportunity, which creates an engagement. Examples include: "Show Up" (simple: inherits turnout's location/time, no specialty), "Morning shift at Fairgrounds" (time variation: different time, same location), "Setup crew at Parking Lot B" (location variation: different location, different time), or "Street Medic - meet at Main & 5th, 1:30pm" (full specification: location, time, specialty). Opportunities can have limits or be open-ended.

## Engagement

An engagement begins when a participant commits to an opportunity. It records what actually happens—whether someone confirmed, canceled, showed up, marked themselves late, or was checked in. Each engagement is a micro-log of one person's interaction with one opportunity. Engagements may be public or private, and can inform social transparency, accountability, and future coordination.

## Participant

Anyone who commits to a turnout by selecting an opportunity. Participants can be anonymous or named. Participation does not require an account or profile. Anyone can participate in one or many turnouts, and each participation generates an engagement.

## Organizer

Anyone who creates and maintains a group and its turnouts. Organizers define opportunities, send invites, manage check-ins, and can view participant engagement histories (depending on visibility settings). Organizers may work alone or collaboratively—multiple organizers can co-manage a group.

## Testimonial

A short, visible statement one user can leave about another, based on shared work in a turnout. Testimonials reflect trust and experience—not status or endorsement. They appear on public profiles when enabled and help support trust-building across the network.

## Profile

An optional, participant-controlled record of public engagements and testimonials. A profile is not a self-authored identity—it emerges from action and recognition. Profiles help organizers discover reliable collaborators and give participants a way to reflect their own history of showing up.
