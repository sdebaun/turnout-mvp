# User Interview Script

**Format:** 30-45 min, conversational. Record with permission. You're listening, not selling.

---

## 0. Framing (2 min)

> "I'm building something and I need to understand the problem better before I build the wrong thing. I'll describe it at the end — for now I want to hear about your experience. There are no wrong answers."

Don't describe the product yet. Seriously.

---

## 1. Their World (10 min)

- Walk me through your last event/action. How did you get people there?
- What tools did you use? (Group chat, Facebook event, email, Eventbrite, Mobilize, whatever)
- How many people said they'd come? How many actually showed?
- What's your best guess for why people flake?

---

## 2. The Pain (10 min)

- What's the most annoying part of coordinating turnout?
- Have you ever had an event fall flat because not enough people showed? What happened?
- What do you wish you knew the day of — before you knew if anyone was coming?
- What do you spend time on that feels like wasted effort?

---

## 3. Concept Reaction (10 min)

*Now describe the core loop: create a turnout, share a link, people RSVP with just a phone number, they get reminders, they check in.*

- Does that solve the problem you described, or does it solve a different problem?
- What would make you hesitant to send this link to your people?
- Phone number only — no email, no password. What's your gut reaction?
- What's missing that would make this a no-brainer?

---

## 4. Pilot (5 min)

- Do you have anything coming up in the next 60 days?
- Would you be willing to use this for it and give me feedback?
- Who else should I be talking to?

---

## After Each Interview

Write down immediately:
- The one sentence that surprised you most
- The assumption it confirms or kills
- Any exact quote worth preserving verbatim

---

## Notes

**The trap to avoid:** Don't let them tell you what to build. You want to understand their pain, not collect a feature wishlist. "I'd love a calendar sync" is noise. "I have no idea if anyone's coming until they show up" is signal.
