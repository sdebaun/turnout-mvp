## Security/Privacy

Notes from conversation with Ian:

- Canary Passwords ("ive been compromised")
- Right-to-delete
- warrant canaries - you can get a gag order from a court that you cant talk about a search warrant. but you can put up a page that says "weve never had a search warrant" and then remove it when you get a search warrant.
- approve or reject testimonials
- badges? more ui/ux
- use llm to check for sock puppets?
