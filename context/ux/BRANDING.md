## Brand Essence

**What we are:** The logistics layer for collective action. A place where showing up becomes possible, then easier, then habitual.

**What we are not:** A protest platform. A civic tech tool. A productivity app. A startup.

**The emotional promise:** _You're not alone in this, and here's how to move together._

**Internal mantra (not public-facing):** Apes strong together. Collective efficacy is the point — not ideology, not identity, not rage. We are stronger when we show up. That's the whole thing.

**Feeling hierarchy (in order):**

1. **Hopeful** — things can change; this is how
2. **Invited** — this is for you, regardless of experience
3. **Trusted** — real people built this for real reasons
4. **Energized** — something's happening; be part of it

The brand lives in that order. Every design decision should reinforce hope and welcome _before_ energy and urgency.

## Primary Audience: The 0–3 Activation Spectrum

This is the single most important audience constraint for brand decisions.

Think of "the spectrum of activation" as a scale from 0 to 10. We are not designing for seasoned organizers or already-activated movement people. We are designing for people who are **0–3 on an activation scale of 0–10**:

- **0** — Never done anything. Got a link from a friend. Curious but skeptical.
- **1** — Cares about something but hasn't shown up yet. Maybe signed a petition.
- **2** — Has gone to one or two things. Pretty sure they're not "an activist."
- **3** — Not your traditional "organizer", but what else do you call it when you start a neighborhood bbq, or a beer club, or a local boardgame game night?
- **4** -
  ...we should fill in 4-10...

**What this means for brand:**

- No movement jargon. No "comrades," no "direct action," no "mutual aid" as a primary frame.
- No ideological signaling that would make a politically ambiguous person feel like they're joining _a side_.
- Convictions are present but not worn on sleeve — we believe showing up matters, we believe in collective power, and we don't need to yell about it.
- A person who's never been to a protest should feel like this was made for them specifically.
- A seasoned organizer should feel like this is a useful tool, not that it's talking down to them.

**The test:** If someone who votes but has never marched sees the homepage, do they feel invited or othered?

## Voice & Tone

The brand voice is the friend who's been doing this work for a while — not the pamphlet, not the rally speech.
That friend knows you show up and put in the work.

**Qualities:**

- **Plain-spoken** — no jargon, no acronyms, no movement speak that excludes newcomers
- **Warm but direct** — doesn't over-explain, doesn't over-promise
- **Action-oriented** — every sentence moves toward _doing_ something, not just thinking about it
- **Quietly confident** — doesn't shout; shows up anyway

**Examples of voice:**

- ✅ "Someone needs you there. Here's how to show up."
- ✅ "Your first turnout. You're ready."
- ✅ "People showed up. You were one of them."
- ✅ "Just your phone number to start. Free forever."
- ❌ "Activate your network and leverage collective action!"
- ❌ "Join the resistance and fight back against oppression!"
- ❌ "Track RSVPs, manage volunteers, and optimize engagement."
- ❌ "No account required." — _a lie. We require a phone number. Say "just your phone number" instead._

**Honesty rule:** Don't obscure friction — describe it accurately. The signup IS low-friction (phone number only, no passwords, no forms), but it's not zero-friction. Saying "no account required" is misleading and erodes trust when users discover otherwise. The honest version is more compelling anyway: "just your phone number" is a concrete, reassuring claim. "No account required" is vague and ends up feeling like a bait-and-switch.

## Color

Three directions to explore. Each is complete — a primary, supporting palette, and a sense of where it lives.

### Direction A — Warm Ground

_Earthy, rooted, community. Feels like a neighborhood meeting, a mutual aid table, a shared meal._

| Role           | Color            | Hex       | Notes                     |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| Primary        | Ochre / Amber    | `#C8831A` | Warm but not alarm-yellow |
| Dark (text/bg) | Deep Brown-Black | `#1C1008` | Replaces pure black       |
| Supporting     | Forest Green     | `#2D5016` | Growth, grounded          |
| Light bg       | Warm Cream       | `#FAF4E8` | Not harsh white           |
| Accent         | Terracotta       | `#B84C2A` | For CTAs, not for danger  |

**Feels like:** WPA poster palettes, community co-op branding, farmers market sensibility but with civic weight.

---

### Direction B — Deep Civic

_Bold and purposeful. Feels like something worth showing up for._

| Role       | Color           | Hex       | Notes                         |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Primary    | Deep Navy       | `#1B2A4A` | Trustworthy weight            |
| Accent     | Warm Amber      | `#E8A020` | Movement/energy against dark  |
| Supporting | Slate           | `#4A6580` | Secondary text, supporting UI |
| Light bg   | Off-White       | `#F5F6F8` | Clean but not sterile         |
| Action     | Amber (lighter) | `#F5B942` | Buttons, CTAs                 |

**Feels like:** Sunrise Movement meets editorial design. Authoritative but not government. Bold but not aggressive.

---

### Direction C — Warm Clarity

_Open and approachable. Feels like a door that's actually open._

| Role       | Color      | Hex       | Notes                         |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Primary    | Sage Green | `#3D6B52` | Hopeful, grounded, not trendy |
| Accent     | Warm Coral | `#D95F3B` | For action, not aggression    |
| Supporting | Sand       | `#C9B99A` | Warmth in neutral areas       |
| Light bg   | Warm White | `#FAFAF7` | Barely tinted                 |
| Dark       | Charcoal   | `#1E2420` | Replaces black                |

**Feels like:** Patagonia-meets-mutual-aid. Environmentally adjacent but human-centered. Hopeful, credible, warm.

## Typography

### Principle

Typography does the heavy lifting on mobile — no room for imagery that doesn't serve the message. Type must be readable in all light conditions, at a glance, on a phone someone's holding in a crowd.

### Recommended Pairings

**Option 1 — Humanist + Geometric**

- **Display / Headlines:** [Plus Jakarta Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Plus+Jakarta+Sans) Bold/ExtraBold — warm humanist, strong contrast at large sizes
- **Body / UI:** [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) Regular/Medium — readable, friendly, not corporate

**Option 2 — Slab + Sans**

- **Display:** [Zilla Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Zilla+Slab) Bold — editorial weight, slight human irregularity
- **Body / UI:** [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) — familiar, readable, accessible

**Option 3 — Single Family (simplest)**

- **All weights:** [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) — rounded, warm, readable across sizes, one family handles everything

### Type Scale (Mobile-first)

```
Display:    2.5rem / 40px   — page titles, hero moments
H1:         1.875rem / 30px — section headers
H2:         1.5rem / 24px   — card titles, turnout names
H3:         1.25rem / 20px  — supporting headers
Body:       1rem / 16px     — default body copy
Small:      0.875rem / 14px — metadata, dates, secondary info
Micro:      0.75rem / 12px  — labels, tags (use sparingly)
```

### Type Rules

- **Line height:** 1.5–1.6 for body; 1.1–1.2 for large display
- **Max line length:** 65ch for body copy (never full-width text on tablet+)
- **Contrast minimum:** WCAG AA (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text) — non-negotiable for mobile readability

## Imagery

### Philosophy

Imagery is not decided yet, but a few principles for when we get there:

- **Authentic over stock** — real people, real moments, real places. Stock photos of smiling volunteers are the enemy.
- **Action over pose** — people doing things, not people looking at camera
- **Diversity by default, not by quota** — the network is for everyone; that should be visible without being performative
- **Context over abstraction** — turnouts happen in specific places: parks, streets, coffee shops. Show that.

### What to avoid

- Hero images of hands raised in unison (cliché protest visual)
- Inspirational sunsets
- Stock "community" photos with matching scarves
- Anything that could be used by a consulting firm on their "impact" page

### Illustration (if needed)

If we add icons or illustrations, lean toward:

- Simple, clean iconography with a slight hand-drawn quality
- NOT flat design cartoon people (startup-cute)
- NOT complex political illustration (protest-coded)

---

## Wordmark / Logo

No strong direction yet. Constraints and explorations to consider:

- **"turnout"** carries more weight than ".network" — the .network is contextual
- Should work at small sizes (browser tab favicon, app icon, small card header)
- Should work without color (accessible contexts, print)
- Avoid: complex iconography, literal imagery (hands, arrows, maps)
- Consider: whether the period in "turnout.network" can be a visual element

---

## Anti-Patterns

Things this brand must never look like:

| Pattern                     | Why                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Corporate SaaS**          | Linear, Notion, Vercel — clean but cold, optimized not human                                                    |
| **Government / civic tech** | USA.gov, Vote.gov — trustworthy but institutional, creates distance                                             |
| **Protest aesthetic**       | Red fists, all-caps agitprop, raised hands — coded for a specific politics that excludes potential participants |
| **Startup-cute**            | Duolingo, Notion avatars, Headspace — gamification and friendly mascots undercut seriousness                    |
| **Nonprofit-generic**       | World Wildlife Fund gradient circles, stock photo volunteers — well-meaning but anonymous                       |

## Brand Applications (future reference)

When designs are built, check them against:

1. **First-time Alice check:** If someone's never done this before, does the landing page make her feel welcome, not intimidated?
2. **Bob's community check:** Would Bob trust this enough to send the link to five friends who are already skeptical of organizing tools?
3. **Mobile readability:** Is it readable at arm's length, in sun, while walking?
4. **Protest-test:** Does it look like something that belongs at a rally? If yes, pull back.
5. **SaaS-test:** Does it look like it has a pricing page? If yes, pull back.
