# The Turnout.Network Vision

**A living network of showing up:  where community, commitment, and cooperation come together in action.**

## 🧭 What This Document Is

This is our **one-year north star**—the aspirational vision of what turnout.network becomes when the foundation is built and the network effects take hold.

**This is not the MVP.** Most of what's described here won't exist for months. The MVP is a much smaller core loop: create a turnout, share a link, RSVP, get reminders, check in. See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for what we're actually building and when.

**This is the guiding principle.** Every feature decision, every UX choice, every technical tradeoff should be evaluated against this vision. If it moves us toward this future, we build it. If it doesn't, we don't.

For humans: this is where we're going. For agents: this is what all decisions should optimize toward, even when building much smaller pieces.

## Overview

It's hard for us to move together. Not because we don’t care, but because we live in a world built to grab our attention, not channel our energy. We get overwhelmed by feeds, distracted by group chats, or lost in apps that reward scrolling more than showing up.

Even when we _want_ to say yes, the follow-through slips away. The link gets lost. The details are vague. The calendar fills up. It’s nobody’s fault—but it still means we don’t move.

turnout.network is a growing pattern of trust and momentum. It helps us help each other show up. Someone creates a turnout. Someone shares it. Someone says yes. A few of us remember, a few more tag along, and suddenly, we're there—together, in space and time.

The turnout.network: people keeping their word, together, one small promise at a time.

It’s for anyone who wants to be part of something real.

If you’ve never shown up before, it’s a simple way to start.

If you’ve been organizing for years, it clears the way for others to join you.

If you’re somewhere in between—trying to help, trying to do more—it’s built for that, too.

## The Turnout Cycle

### Creating a turnout

When something needs doing, someone creates a turnout. A time, a place, a reason. Something people can say yes to.

On turnout.network, that means creating a simple call to action with a date, a time, a place, and a short description. The turnout becomes a link: easy to share, easy to pass along, easy to commit to. No login required. No flyers or campaigns. Just a clear ask, ready to be answered.

### Showing up for it

Then people start to say yes. They commit. It just takes a tap, a name, a promise made visible. That turnout becomes real because someone decided to be part of it. A reminder lands. The time comes. And they show up—not alone, but with others who said yes too.

When someone RSVPs, turnout.network sends them smart reminders—timed to help, not spam. Add it to your calendar, get directions, change your mind if needed. When it's time, check-in makes the commitment visible—not to perform, but to be counted. This is the core of the network: people showing up, counted, together.

### Moments to Momentum

Every time we show up, we get stronger—individually, and together. We learn who's steady. We start to recognize each other. Trust builds through action. Turnouts connect. Patterns form. And what began as one invitation becomes the start of something we can build on.

turnout.network knows who's shown up, and it uses that history to help new turnouts grow. Looking for another turnout to show up for? The network surfaces it. Creating one yourself? It brings the steady hands that you didn't know were nearby.

## The Shape of the Network

turnout.network isn’t just a tool—it’s an ecosystem. What it does _and_ what it refuses to do are equally important. These are some of the principles and capabilities that shape how the network works in the real world.

### From First Turnouts to Global Movements

turnout.network is simple enough for one person to create their first turnout—but it's built to grow with you. As your momentum builds, the network supports more turnouts, more participants, and more people stepping in to help.

You can run three turnouts a week or thirty. You can bring in co-organizers and distribute the load. The network doesn't require roles and permissions up front, but it supports them when they emerge—because organizing isn't a fixed structure, it's a pattern of shared responsibility.

Whether you're organizing a neighborhood cleanup, a mutual aid network, or a national campaign, turnout.network scales by staying focused on what matters: helping people say yes, helping them follow through, and helping organizers know who’s ready for more.

### The Open Door Principle

turnout.network prioritizes participation over protection. It’s built to be easy to enter, easy to commit, and easy to pass along—because that’s what showing up requires.

We’re not trying to replace encrypted channels like Signal or build hardened infrastructure for secure organizing. Those tools already exist and do their jobs well. This network is for the moments before and after those channels—when it’s time to say yes, share the link, and show up.

That means we don't promise secrecy, encryption, or strong identity guarantees. It's open by design. If what you're doing depends on secrecy, use Signal. If what you're doing depends on turnout, we're here.

### Connects with What You Already Use

You don't need a whole new set of tools. turnout.network works with what people are already using to coordinate: group chats, email threads, calendar invites, SMS lists, even flyers with QR codes.

Whether you organize in a Signal thread, a Discord server, or a church bulletin, turnout.network plugs into the way your community already talks to itself. The goal isn’t to create a new platform—it’s to make action show up _in the channels where you already have trust_.

We’re not asking people to switch tools. We’re giving them a way to move in sync, wherever they already are.

### Shared Work, Shared Words

Your profile on turnout.network isn’t something you write—it’s something that’s built through action and trust.

Every turnout you show up for becomes part of your public or private history. Others see what you've done, if you choose to share it. And when you've done something real with someone—when you've organized together, worked a shift, or showed up side-by-side—you can leave a short, visible testimonial. A record of shared effort.

This kind of transparency makes it easier to move together. It helps people step into new turnouts with more confidence, and helps organizers invite others into deeper roles—based on shared history, not guesswork.

### As Free as Possible

turnout.network isn’t freemium. We don’t lock useful features behind payment walls or hide basic functionality until you upgrade.

Instead, anything that’s cheap to run is free to use. The only things we charge for are the parts that cost real money to operate—like mass messaging, high-volume coordination tools, or deeply custom infrastructure. When that happens, it’s usage-based, not tiered.

The goal is to keep the network accessible at every level of participation. Whether you're showing up for your first turnout or coordinating a national campaign, you'll never hit a paywall just for doing the work.

## The Journey From Here

This vision describes where we're going, not where we are.

**Right now:** We're building the foundation—the core loop that makes showing up reliable. Create, share, commit, remind, check-in. The basics that most organizing tools get wrong.

**Soon after:** We add the pieces that make organizing easier—group dashboards, co-organizer collaboration, better discovery.

**The long game:** We build the network effects. Reputation that emerges from action. Discovery that surfaces opportunities. Trust that becomes infrastructure.

Every step moves toward this north star. Every decision should ask: does this get us closer to a world where showing up is easy, where organizing compounds, where trust becomes infrastructure?

That's the vision. Now let's build it.
