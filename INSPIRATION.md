# Christopher Hitchens

"There is a particular, wretched kind of cowardice in watching the world burn from the comfort of your sofa. We have been sold the lie that our only power lies in a ballot box once every four years. Turnout is the antidote to that engineered helplessness. It is the platform for those who realized that 'caring' is a cheap sentiment unless it is backed by the physical presence of a human body in a room. Don't just sit there—turn out, or admit you don't actually give a damn."

# Terry Pratchett

"There’s a great deal of talk about 'Them.' They should fix the schools. They should look after the vulnerable. But if you look closely at the gears of the world, you’ll find that 'They' are often just a handful of people in expensive suits counting on the fact that you’re too busy, too tired, or too alone to notice you have more power than they do.

Turnout is the platform for the moment you stop looking for 'Them' and start looking at the person standing next to you. It’s a gateway to the kind of collective strength that starts with a handshake and ends with a community that can’t be shoved aside. We provide the logistics for mutual aid and direct action because we’ve realized that 'Us' is a much larger and more capable group than anyone led us to believe. It’s about the simple, undeniable power of being present."

# Peter Capaldi's Twelfth Doctor

You spend your lives looking up. You look at the sky, you look at the screens, you look at the great and the good—or the great and the spectacularly mediocre—and you wait. You wait for a plan. You wait for a sign. You wait for a man in a box or a woman in a suit to come along and say, "Don't worry, I’ve got this."

Well, I’ve got news for you. "They" aren't coming. "They" are far too busy being important and having meetings about meetings.

Turnout is the moment you stop being a passenger. It’s the moment you realize that the most dangerous thing in the cosmos isn't a tyrant with a grudge; it’s a group of ordinary humans who have decided to stand in a line and stay there.

We aren't here to give you a hobby. We’re here to give you a gateway. Because being "decent" isn't a state of mind—it’s an act of defiance. It’s showing up when it would be much easier to stay at home and have a nice cup of tea while the world grinds itself into dust.

It starts with a handshake. It ends with a community that "They" can’t ignore, because "They" are small, and "Us" is vast. It’s about being present. It’s about being kind. And it’s about being a monumental pain in the backside to anyone who thinks they can run the world without asking you first.

# Hunter S. Thompson

"We have been conditioned to believe that our only role in the machinery of the world is to watch it break and moan about the debris. It’s a comfortable sort of paralysis, isn’t it? Turnout is the platform for those who have finally had enough of the view. We provide the logistics for the people who realize that 'caring' is just a hobby until you actually occupy a space. We aren't selling salvation; we’re selling agency. It’s the difference between watching the tide come in and building a levee. Get off the couch and get into the game, or stop complaining about the score."
